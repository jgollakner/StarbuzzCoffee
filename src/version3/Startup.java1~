/**
 * This version represents the third attempt by Starbuzz Coffee to
 * handle beverage sales with varying beverages and condiments. This version
 * implements the Decorator Pattern and proves to be a huge improvement in
 * maintainability. No rigidity here ... you can add new condiment classes
 * or change existing ones without breaking code. You can add new beverages
 * and not break code. (Note: prices are hard-coded in right now, but they
 * don't have to be ... they can come from a properties file or database.
 *
 * P.S. How would you implement a CashRegister class with this version,
 * without adding rigidity?
